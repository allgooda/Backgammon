#BACKGAMMON

##USER STORIES

    -As a player, when I play back gammon, I like to play on a felt board (design a board that looks like a real board, or one of my own design?)

    -As a player, in order to start the game, I need a way to decide who goes first and choose my color.

	-As a competitive player, i play back gammon so i can keep score, i would like something that displays my score so i can rub it in my opponents face.

	-As a player, i would like a way to keep track of who’s turn it is.

	-As a player, i need to roll dice, to figure out how many spaces to move my piece.

	-When I roll the dice, if i roll doubles (two sixes), my move should count for double (4 sixes).

	-When I roll the dice, I should able to use each value separately when moving pieces. Eg. if i roll a 2 and a 4. I should be able to move one piece 4 spots and another 2 spots OR one piece 6 spots if possible. (double sixes would mean 4 separate sixes)

	-My opponent should not be able to make a move if they do not roll the exact amount needed to move (ie. if they are being blocked by my pieces).

	-As a player sometimes I move a piece but then change my mind. I would like a way to reset if i have not finished a move.

	-As a player, when I land on another player’s piece, the piece should be eliminated from the board.

	-As a player, if I roll a specific #, I should be able to bring my piece back if it has been eliminated by another player.

	-In order to win my opponent must first have all pieces in his home quadrant. At that point he/she will then be able to move the pieces off the board.

	-As a player once I move all my pieces to my home quadrant and then off the board I should be the winner.

	-As a player, if the other player has all there pieces in the home quadrant, but I eliminate a lone piece, the opponent should not be able to move them off of the board.
	
	-As a user, I think backgammon is a boring old man’s game.  I would like it to be more exciting. (Randomization option, whenever a player rolls doubles, their is also a 50-50 chance of randomizing the entire board?)
