# BACKGAMMON

## DESCRIPTION

-The game I made is called backgammon, it is one of the oldest games in the world. It is a two player board game. One player is white and the other black. The object of the game is for one player to get all 15 of their pieces to the other side of the board and into their home base.

##INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

-Go to this link: http://allgooda.github.io/first_project/

-Click roll to begin playing. As I have it now, black always goes first. I will eventually add a feature to decide who goes first, but until then you will have to decide on your own. May I suggest flipping a coin?

#### UNSOLVED ISSUES

### Current
- [ ] As a player, if I have not selected a di, I should not be able to select a piece

### MVP
- [ ] As a player sometimes I move a piece but then change my mind. I would like a way to reset if i have not finished a move.
### Icebox/U
- [ ] As a player, in order to start the game, I need a way to decide who goes first.
- [ ] As a player, i would like a way to keep track of who’s turn it is.
- [ ] As a player I would like a way to enter my Name.
- [ ] As a player When I roll the dice, if i roll doubles (two sixes), my move should count for double (4 sixes).
- [ ] As a user, I think backgammon is a boring old man’s game.  I would like it to be more exciting. (Randomization option, whenever a player rolls doubles, their is also a 50-50 chance of randomizing the entire board?)
- [ ] As a player, when I play back gammon, I like to play on a felt board (design a board that looks like a real board, or one of my own design?
- [ ] As a competitive player, i play back gammon so i can keep score, i would like something that displays my score so i can rub it in my opponents face.
